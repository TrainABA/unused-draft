<h1>Welcome to TrainABA, Inc.</h1>
</div>

<div class="jumbotron">

	<p>We proudly celebrate our fourth year as a fully ABA-community supported company. No grants, no billing codes; we are 100 percent yours. On every front around the world, ABA practitioners battle quality vs. quantity. You have to fight your own battles but we are on the sidelines screaming for you to win, throwing Malatov cocktails at threats to quality, wearing leather jackets and slicking our hair back with switchblade combs.</p>
	<p>TrainABA does only one thing: organize various educational materials to promote high-integrity behavior analysis. We are community-oriented so our materials are organized for settings (e.g., agency, university), process (e.g., seeking or maintaining credentials), and position (e.g., supervisor, technician, non-clinical administrators).We see the proliferation of ABA as one complex problem of quality vs. quantity, played out in various ways around the world.</p>
	<p>We promote a community-centered approach, which is why our resources go beyond behavior analyst's contingencies and analyze CEOs, accountants, bookkeepers, HR managers, and secretaries.</p>
	<p> You do not find TrainABA materials for parent training, and client goals. Those things are important but it is not what we do. TrainABA makes OBM procedures for the ABA service provider industry. Think of people who would attend ABAInternational and their respective subordinates, employers, and universities. That's who TrainABA is for. The missing piece is predicting and controlling behavior in the organization, including a bit of theory-driven attention to dynamics. Using ABA in the organization is not theoretically more difficult than with a client but we get less time and training to focus on those problems.<p>
	<p>TrainABA specializes in analyzing and solving those problems, so we have expertise to offer you on that topic of using OBM within ABA organizations.</p>
	<p>Eventually, the science and practice of OBM will have more required hours taught in universities and greater representation on future BACB task lists. That kind of change may take a decade or more to impact you. In the meantime, we are here to share expertise and provide tools to help you. We went back to school to earn business degrees and doctoral work in ABA, OBM, and it's close cousin industrial-organizational psychology.</p>
	<p>We want you to use our expertise and share it with people at your work. We are not greedy and we do not have a goal of becoming rich and famous. We just want to make good stuff that a lot of ABA students and professionals use. We sincerely hope you want that, too. If you support us, it isn't going to cost you much of anyting (time, money, effort) but you'll get a lot of it. Hopefully, you will see that we are like you -- behavior analysts who get frustrated when quality is threatened and want to do something about it.</p>     
	<p>Hopefully, this writing sheds more light on what we mean by, "TrainABA is an OBM and continuing education resource for developing credentialed applied behavior analsis teams." You may already know our operations are in a holding pattern until our founder takes his PhD comprehensive exam in summer 2017. We are not offering support at this time and have elected to offer our materials freely to the ABA community. We invite you to take a tour. We suspect you will find at least one helpful thing you did not know existed but have thought, at one time or another, "Somebody should make something for that."</p>
 
	<p>TrainABA has the best terms in the world: No login is needed. Freely use, copy, modify, and distribute at your sole discretion so long as you grant the same freedom to the next person. No warranty or merchantibility is promised or implied. The rationale is twofold: transparency helps the ABA community; extra sales and business-side activity takes time away from building and refining TrainABA materials.</p>

If you like what you see and want us to continue existing, please support us by buying a book, conributing, or making a donation. We need money to afford the time it takes to make these things.</p>
