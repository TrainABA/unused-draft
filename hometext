	<p>It is frustrating to be a behavior analyst when you do not have enough control over quality. Direct care technicians provide the most hours but have the least training and experience. We get so caught up in the moment that we forget to step back and realize thousands of behavior analysts are in the same predicament.</p>

	<p>Computer engineering is needed for technical interventions to scale. promote involves OBM and professional development. TrainABA is for behavior analysts seeking more control over quality. We proudly celebrate our fourth year fully supported by the ABA-community. For three years, we had no grants, no billing codes, no marketing/advertising, or corporate sponsorships. Our top two leaders focused on their PhD coursework putting TrainABA on hold. Without promotion, a total of 2,000 behavior analysts found our materials and TrainABA seeking more control over quality. TrainABA is only part of what it takes. We have added more resources for professional and organizational development.</p>
        <p>educational materials to promote high-integrity behavior analysis. We are community-oriented so our materials are organized for settings (e.g., agency, university), process (e.g., seeking or maintaining credentials), and position (e.g., supervisor, technician, non-clinical administrators).We see the proliferation of ABA as one complex problem of quality vs. quantity, played out in various ways around the world.</p>
        <p>We promote a community-centered approach, which is why our resources go beyond behavior analyst's contingencies and analyze CEOs, accountants, bookkeepers, HR managers, and secretaries.</p>
